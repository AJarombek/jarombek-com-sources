# jarombek-com-sources

This repository will hold code snippets for the blog posts and discovery posts on jarombek.com (Work In Progress).  
The structure of the repo is as follows:

```
> Year
--> Month
----> Post Name
------> Demo Code
```

Although the website is not created yet, I will begin populating this repository with blog posts and discoveries.  
There are two pieces to each post - the HTML and any additional demo code
