# jarombek-com-submittions

This repository will hold code snippets for the blog posts and discovery posts on jarombek.com (Work In Progress).  
The structure of the repo is as follows:

> > Blog
> --> Year
> ----> Post Name
> ------> HTML
> ------> Demo Code
>
> > Discoveries
> --> Year
> ----> Month
> ------> Discovery Name
> --------> HTML
> --------> Demo Code

Although the website is not created yet, I will begin populating this repository with blog posts and discoveries.  
There are two pieces to each post - the HTML and any additional demo code
