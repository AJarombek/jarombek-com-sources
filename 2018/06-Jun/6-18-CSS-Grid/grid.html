        Nice easy morning run around Rockefeller.  Still not going on long runs yet,
        trying to prevent injury with the short runs.

        Feeling good the morning after the race.  Beautiful warm morning running on the beach.
        Half of the run was on the wet sand and the other half was on dry sand.

        Went into the race looking to run 5:30 pace.  Even split the entire race!  One kid
        stayed on me for the first 2.5 miles but he was just trying to hang on so I never had to
        speed up :).  Felt really good, had a ton left at the end.
