                        Yesterday I began to fix some bugs in my website 
                        <a href="https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf">saintsxctf.com</a> 
                        and its corresponding native iOS and Android apps (because as we know a 
                        codebase is never complete).  I was looking at the Swift code for my iOS app and found a bug where I incorrectly selected a substring 
                        from a base64 encoded image.  Luckily the fix was easy to implement, but viewing the code made me remember just how confusing the String 
                        structure was in Swift.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You would think something as simple as a string would be straightforward, but in Swift there were a few quirks.  I wrote the code in Xcode 
                        8 and Swift 3 this fall.  Since then Xcode 9 and Swift 4 have released, making <code>String</code> a bit less confusing.  I will dive into strings in 
                        Swift 3 and then look at how the code has changed with Swift 4.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Swift 3</h5>
                    <p>
                        The first quirk of strings in Swift 3 is obvious when you try to get the length of a string.  There is no length or count variable on the 
                        <code>String</code> structure.  Instead each <code>String</code> has a <code>characters</code> variable of type <code>CharacterView</code> 
                        which is a collection of all the characters in the string.  You can use the <code>characters</code> object to get the strings size or iterate 
                        over all the characters.
                    </p>

hello.characters.count // 23

// The characters object is a collection of Character objects
let chars: String.CharacterView = hello.characters

// You can peform operations on the characters collection just like any other collection
chars.forEach {
    char -> Void in
    
    print(char)
}</code>
