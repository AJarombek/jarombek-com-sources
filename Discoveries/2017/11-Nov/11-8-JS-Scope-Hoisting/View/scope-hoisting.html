                        JavaScript has quickly become one of the languages that I use the most (probably second behind Java).  Many people use JavaScript along 
                        with one of its many frontend frameworks (JQuery, AngularJS, etc.) without really knowing how the core language operates.  I don’t want to 
                        be one of those people!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This will be the first of many discovery posts on JavaScript.  Let’s look at one of the basic concepts of the language: how variables interact 
                        with scope.  By scope I mean the area of a program you can access a variable (e.g. a variable declared in a function can only be accessed within 
                        that function).  You can also think of scope as the execution environment for a line in a program.  The scope is all the other variables and 
                        functions this program line is aware of.  In JavaScript scope can get a bit tricky.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One tricky part is that declared variables in JavaScript get hoisted to the top of their scope.  Let’s look at a quick code snippet.
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <pre class="line-numbers">
                            <code class="language-javascript" title="JavaScript" contenteditable="true" spellcheck="false">console.info(x);  // Error??

var x = 10;</code>
                        </pre>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        For a Java developer like myself when first starting JavaScript I expected an error.  Variable x hasn’t been declared yet!  However, JavaScript 
                        returns <code>undefined</code>, which means the variable has been declared but not initialized a variable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What’s happening is JavaScript splits the statement <code>var x = 10</code> into its declaration and assignment.  It then ‘hoists’ the declaration 
                        to the top of the scope (in this case the global program scope).  Before the call to <code>console.info()</code> there is a line created that contains 
                        <code>var x;</code>.  Tricky JavaScript!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now if you are using ES6+ and don’t want hoisting you can use the <code>let</code> keyword (replace <code>var</code> with <code>let</code> in the previous 
                        example).  Now if you run the code the <code>console.info(x)</code> call will throw an error.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here is one more basic example:
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <pre class="line-numbers">
                            <code class="language-javascript" title="JavaScript" contenteditable="true" spellcheck="false">{
let firstName = "Andy";
  var lastName = "Jarombek";
  
  console.info(firstName); // Andrew
  console.info(lastName); // Jarombek
}

console.info(lastName); // Jarombek
console.info(firstName); // Reference Error</code>
                        </pre>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        In JavaScript you can define a scope with the <code>{ }</code> block.  You can see that the <code>let</code> statement is only available within the block scope 
                        while the variable defined with <code>var</code> is exposed to the global scope<sup>1</sup>.  This can be useful when you want to constrain a variable to one 
                        small piece of code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One thing that the <code>{ }</code> block behavior made me question was ‘are variables defined in functions available globally?’  The answer is NO (thankfully) so your internally 
                        defined function variables are local and safe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can check out the code for these examples

                        at how variables in for loops leak into the global scope in JavaScript (Yuck! – but there is a solution with <code>let</code>).
